- React Finland happened, [here](https://twitter.com/_Tx3/status/1123509987953844224) is a recap
- Seems that [ReactGirls](https://twitter.com/ReactJSgirls) that happened May 2 & 3 in London [was pretty awesome](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1124365202819026951), [Dan's thread](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1124227463985475584), 
- Microsoft is [launches](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/microsoft-launches-react-native-for-windows/) react native on [windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows). This means that we can write UWP apps with `react-native` and run it with `react-native run-windows`. Will need to run on windows to build though.
